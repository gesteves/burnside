After almost four years on [Tumblr][tumblr], I've decided it's time to switch blog platforms. My blog now runs on [Octopress][octo] and [Heroku][her].

[tumblr]: http://www.tumblr.com
[octo]: http://octopress.org
[her]: http://www.heroku.com
[legend]: http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/
[aet]: http://tumblr.gesteves.com

The advantages are clear: yadda, yadda. I also like that it makes backups really simple: the posts live on my computer, so they get backed up to Time Machine and SuperDuper as part of my regular backup process; my Sites folder is symlinked in my Dropbox folder, so there's a backup there too; and finally, since the posts are also under source control, everything gets committed to my Github repo as well.

A few other things of note:

* The theme is mostly built from scratch, based on the design of [my website][web]. Unfortunately, I mostly destroyed all the sensible patterns and defaults [Brandon][imathis] (the creator of Octopress) created for theming it, so I think I'll have to do some work rebuilding them to keep the code more organized. I did keep his awesome port of [Solarized][sol] syntax highlighting, though.
* I modified it for deployment to Heroku. This included, on Brandon's instructions, removing the `public` folder from `.gitignore`, but I also added everything *but* `public` and the config files to `.slugignore`, to keep the slug size as small as possible; and I added a rake task for Heroku deployment, which is mostly a copy of the default Github one, but pushing to Heroku `master` instead.
* I wanted to use [iA Writer][ia] as my blogging software, so I modified the `new_post` rake task so that it calls `open #{filename}` at the end, which opens the newly created post in the default editor for Markdown files, which I has previously set to Writer.
* I also symlinked the `_posts` folder to the [Writer][ia] and [Elements][ele] folders in my Dropbox, so I could theoretically write posts from my iPad and iPhone, although I'd have to SSH into my computer to actually publish them.
* I still haven't decided whether or not I want comments here, or if I want to use [Disqus][disqus] or [Facebook Comments][fbc]. In the meantime, you can [tweet @gesteves][tweet] with any comments.
* I didn't import any of the old content from Tumblr; I couldn't figure out a good way to do it without breaking a ton of links, since Tumblr's permalink format doesn't match Octopress's. I could modify Octopress's permalinks and work something with my Tumblr backup, but instead I opted for a clean break and a fresh start, and I'm using a bit of Sinatra code to 301-redirect any traffic looking for a Tumblr permalink to my Tumblr's [new domain][aet].

Anyway, I'm not entirely sure how much or how often I'll write here -- Twitter & Tumblr seem to have atrophied my ability to write more than 140 characters at a time (writing this post took longer than I care to admit) -- but I do hope to at least compile interesting web design & development resources I find, in the style of [Assaf Arkin][assaf]'s "Rounded Corners" series -- which I love -- and maybe get back in the habit of writing well enough to, you know, express, like, opinions and stuff.
