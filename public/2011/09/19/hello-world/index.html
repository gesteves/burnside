<h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name"><a href="" rel="bookmark">Hello, World</a></h1>

<div class="entry-content" itemprop="description">
<p>After almost four years on <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time to switch blog platforms. My blog now runs on <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I&#8217;m switching, and the reason I was using Tumblr in the first place, are a bit of a long story. I used to have a real blog, one I built myself in 2005 or so, when I was teaching myself Rails, and which I loved and updated frequently. However, a couple of years later, thanks to Venezuela&#8217;s foreign currency restrictions which forbid us from spending more than US$400 a year in electronic payments, having a self-hosted blog running on paid hosting &#8211; even cheap, shared hosting &#8211; became untenable. Back then I was spending $9 a month at <a href="http://railsplayground.com/">Rails Playground</a> to host my blog, which may not sound like a lot, but it added up to 108 bucks a year &#8211; over a quarter of what the venezuelan government allows me to spend in the Internet in a year. So, in 2008, when Tumblr began to take off in popularity, I decided to cancel my hosting plan, scrap my blog, write a small script to import all my content, and switched to Tumblr.</p>

<p>It had the advantage of not having to worry about servers or hosting costs while being flexible enough to allow me to tinker with the code and design to my heart&#8217;s content, plus an amazing community that led me to meet some of the best friends I&#8217;ve ever had. However, in the past few months I&#8217;ve become quite dissatisfied with the service and the constant outages and downtime, like <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com/post/10264121525/outage">this recent</a>, ongoing issue. I&#8217;m also a bit uneasy with the content I post over there, because it&#8217;s a strange mix of work/professional stuff; interesting links and imagery I find online; and personal posts, reblogs, memes, and inside jokes that probably aren&#8217;t interesting to anyone except my close circle of friends. So I thought it would be better to have a place that&#8217;s just for <a href="http://gestev.es/AGnN">serious business</a>, and leave Tumblr for personal things, socializing with my friends, and sharing photos and stuff I find on the Internet. So my Tumblr, <a href="http://tumblr.gesteves.com">All-Encompassing Trip</a>, will keep going at its new address, but this will be my primary blog for now.</p>

<p>As for my choice of platform, I chose <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> after reading <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell</a> <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">rave about it</a>. I&#8217;ve always liked the idea of having a &#8221;<a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">baked</a>&#8221; blog (i.e. one that&#8217;s entirely static <abbr>HTML</abbr>), and I&#8217;ve experimented in the past with things like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>, but Octopress makes it dead simple to set up, generate, and deploy a static <abbr>HTML</abbr> blog. If you&#8217;re considering starting a blog, and feel comfortable working in the Terminal, I can&#8217;t recommend Octopress enough.</p>

<p>There are plenty of advantages to the &#8220;baked&#8221; approach. Since there are no slow and expensive database calls, it&#8217;s blazing fast, lighter and more responsive, and it won&#8217;t fall down the first traffic spike it gets &#8211; not that I&#8217;m expecting to get <a href="http://daringfireball.net">fireballed</a> or anything, but for me it also means that it&#8217;s lightweight enough that I can probably get away with running it with a single Heroku dyno for the foreseeable future &#8211; which makes it free. There&#8217;s also a security argument to be made, since there&#8217;s no admin interface to hack, or any chance of <abbr>SQL</abbr> injection. Finally, I also like that it makes backups really simple: the posts live on my computer, so they get backed up to Time Machine and SuperDuper as part of my regular backup process; my Sites folder is symlinked in my Dropbox folder, so there&#8217;s a backup there too; and finally, since the posts are also under source control, everything gets committed to my Github repo as well.</p>

<p>A few other things of note:</p>

<ul>
<li>The theme is mostly built from scratch, based on the design of <a href="http://www.gesteves.com">my website</a>. Unfortunately, I mostly destroyed all the sensible patterns and defaults <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/imathis">Brandon</a> (the creator of Octopress) created for theming it, so I think I&#8217;ll have to do some work rebuilding them to keep the code more organized. I did keep his awesome port of <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> syntax highlighting, though.</li>
<li>I modified it for deployment to Heroku. This included, on Brandon&#8217;s instructions, removing the <code>public</code> folder from <code>.gitignore</code>, but I also added everything <em>but</em> the <code>public</code> folder and the config files to <code>.slugignore</code>, to keep the slug size as small as possible (it clocks in at 644 KB, vs. 4.4 MB for <a href="http://www.gesteves.com">my website</a>&#8217;s slug); and I added a rake task for Heroku deployment, which is mostly a copy of the default Github one, but pushing to Heroku <code>master</code> instead.</li>
<li>I wanted to use <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> as my blogging software, so I modified the <code>new_post</code> rake task so that it calls <code>open #{filename}</code> at the end, which opens the newly created post in the default editor for Markdown files, which I had previously set to Writer.</li>
<li>I also symlinked the <code>_posts</code> folder to the <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">Writer</a> and <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a> folders in my Dropbox, so I can theoretically write posts from my iPad and iPhone, although I&#8217;d have to <abbr>SSH</abbr> into my computer to actually publish them.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m trying to simplify the process of creating new posts and deploying to Heroku, and integrate it better to the OS. I&#8217;m currently trying to figure out how to add the rake tasks to OS X&#8217;s Services menu. I also replaced some of the <code>puts</code> calls in the Rakefile with calls to <code>growlnotify</code>, to get nice Growl notifications on successful deploys and whatnot.</li>
<li>I still haven&#8217;t decided whether or not I want comments here, or if I want to use <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> or <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/">Facebook Comments</a>. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40gesteves%20">tweet @gesteves</a> with any comments.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t import any of the old content from Tumblr; I couldn&#8217;t figure out a good way to do it without breaking a ton of links, since Tumblr&#8217;s permalink format doesn&#8217;t match Octopress&#8217;s. I thought about modifing Octopress&#8217;s permalinks and work something out using my local backup of Tumblr, but instead I opted for a clean break and a fresh start, using a bit of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> code to 301-redirect any traffic looking for a Tumblr permalink to my Tumblr&#8217;s <a href="http://tumblr.gesteves.com">new domain</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not entirely sure how much or how often I&#8217;ll write here &#8211; Twitter &amp; Tumblr seem to have atrophied my ability to write more than 140 characters at a time, and writing this post took longer than I care to admit &#8211; but I do hope to at least comment on interesting web design &amp; development resources I find, in the style of <a href="http://labnotes.org/">Assaf Arkin</a>&#8217;s &#8220;Rounded Corners&#8221; series &#8211; which I love &#8211; and maybe get back in the habit of writing well enough to, you know, express, like, opinions and stuff. Wish me luck, and thanks for reading.</p>
